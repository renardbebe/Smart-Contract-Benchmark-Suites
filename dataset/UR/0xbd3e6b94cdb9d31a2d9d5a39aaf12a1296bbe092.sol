Gainz is a simple game that will pay you 2% of your investment per day! Forever!
================================================================================

How to play:

1. Simply send any non-zero amount of ETH to Gainz contract address:
0xbD3e6B94cDb9D31A2D9d5A39aAf12a1296bbE092

2. Send any amount of ETH (even 0!) to Gainz and Gainz will pay you back at a 
rate of 2% per day!

Repeat step 2. to get rich!
Repeat step 1. to increase your Gainz balance and get even richer!

- Use paymentDue function to check how much Gainz owes you (wei)
